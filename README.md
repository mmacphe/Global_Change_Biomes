# Global Change Biomes

This respository includes instructions for building Figure 1 included in our manuscript "An introduction to predictive distribution modelling for conservation to welcome novel perspectives" (MacPherson et al. 2021; link to be added soon). 

## If using this figure, please cite MacPherson et al. 2021.

Our Figure builds Whittaker style climographs (Whittaker 1975) for the 14 global terrestrial biomes recongized by The World Wildlife Fund (https://www.worldwildlife.org/publications/terrestrial-ecoregions-of-the-world).

We also show the predicted changes in temperature and precipitation for global terrestrial biomes for 2081-2100 using the worst-case scenario from CanESM5 global climate model data (Meinhausen et al., 2020).
